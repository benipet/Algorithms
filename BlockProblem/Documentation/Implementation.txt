The Block Problem Programming Implementation
==============================================

	Contents
	1. Block Management
	2. Block Manipulation
	3. Block system implementation
	

1. Block Management
	Storing and Moving the blocks in the computer memory
	
	Propeties of a block:
	1. Index id 
	2. itself position    //The block of itself
	3. bottom block       //The address of bottom block
	4. above block	      //The address of above block

	Rule of the blocks
	1. If the block no have bottom address the block is on itself position
	2. If the block no have above block the block is the top of on the stack
	3. If the block have both: bottom and above -> the block is member of a stack

	Block Functions:
	-init_block   			//initizalize a block in the memory
	-link_block   			//link a block as above block
	(-append_block 			//set the bottom address to the appended block)
	-reset_block  			//reset the bottom block to NULL
	-get_blockById			//returns the block itself position
	-is_top				//returns 0 if no 1 if yes

	Stack Functions (the stack is piled blocks):
	-define_stackById: 		//Returns the last block position of a given blockId
	-remove_stackById:		//Remove a stack by block id. The new position of the stack is the given block Id.
	-move_stack:			//Move a stack onto the given stack
				

2. Block Manipulation
	How to manipulate the Block moving by user command by standard input.
	(?)


3. Block System Implementation
	Implement the block system with Block Manipulated and Block Management. And display it 
	on the standard input.

	Init Functions:
	init_blockSystem		//Initialize the blocks with the given int number

	Move Functions:
	move_onto			
		
	move_over
	
	Pile Functions:
	pile_onto
	pile_over
